**Past Week's Macro Releases (Jan 5-12, 2026)**  
No major official macro releases occurred across the US, Eurozone, China, Japan, UK, or Korea in the past week matching growth, inflation, labor, housing, external/trade, or credit categories. Recent prior data, such as US November CPI at 2.7% YoY (down from 3.0% prior, but distorted by government shutdown affecting collection), showed benign inflation without week-over-week shifts. Korea's November CPI rose 2.4% YoY (up slightly from 2.1% in September, driven by agriculture and petroleum), indicating sticky pressures versus October's 2.4%, with no acute change. China's November trade surplus narrowed to $23.74B with US (from $24.76B prior), reflecting softer exports amid tariffs, but not a past-week release.
