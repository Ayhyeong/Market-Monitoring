US, Eurozone, China, Japan, UK, Korea — past week highlights
- US: Focus shifts to PCE/GDP updates this week after disrupted CPI cadence; BEA flags a Dec 23 update to Q3 PCE components, making last week relatively data-light on official inflation prints. Implication: little change in the inflation narrative until PCE lands. [bea](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index)
- Eurozone: Final November HICP confirmed at 2.1% y/y, unchanged from October; services remains sticky at 3.5%, while food disinflates and energy drag narrows. Implication: headline stable, core stickiness persists via services. [ec.europa](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-euro-indicators/w/2-17122025-ap)
- China: November activity softened—industrial output slowed to 4.8% y/y and retail sales to 1.3% y/y, signaling weaker domestic demand even as exports help headline growth. Implication: growth momentum cooled vs prior month; policy focus on demand support remains warranted. [whbl](https://whbl.com/2025/12/14/chinas-factory-output-retail-sales-weaken-in-november/)
- Japan: National CPI for November printed ~2.9% y/y; core (ex-fresh food) ~3.0% y/y, little change from October. Implication: inflation remains above 2%, with limited deceleration—keeps normalization debate live. [fxstreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/japans-national-cpi-rises-29-yoy-in-november-core-cpi-climbs-as-expected-202512182331)
- UK: CPI fell sharply to 3.2% y/y in November (from 3.6%), and core eased to 3.2%—lowest since Dec 2024. Implication: meaningful disinflation vs last week’s priors; raises near-term odds of BoE easing path discussions. [ons.gov](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/november2025)
- Korea: Authorities report CPI running 2.4% y/y and unemployment around low 2s; separate trackers show the jobless rate rising to 2.7% SA in November, suggesting a mild softening in labor momentum. Implication: inflation contained; labor marginally softer vs prior month. [english.moef.go](https://english.moef.go.kr/pc/selectTbPressCenterDtl.do?boardCd=N0001&seq=6316)

What changed vs last week (and why)
- Eurozone inflation: No meaningful change; final November HICP confirmed 2.1% y/y, with services sticky—consistent with prior flash. Rationale: revisions small; composition unchanged. [tradingeconomics](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi)
- China growth: Deteriorated vs prior month (industrial output and retail sales both slowed), highlighting weaker domestic demand into year-end. Rationale: NBS November prints missed expectations and prior levels. [reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-factory-output-retail-sales-weaken-november-2025-12-15/)
- UK inflation: Meaningful downside shift to 3.2% y/y, below the prior 3.6%; core also down to 3.2%. Rationale: broader discounting/Black Friday effects and easing OOH costs contributed. [reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-inflation-falls-32-before-bank-england-rate-decision-2025-12-17/)
- Japan inflation: Essentially stable/slightly lower; national headline ~2.9% and core ~3.0% y/y. Rationale: minimal deceleration from October; no step-change. [tradingeconomics](https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/consumer-price-index-cpi)
- Korea labor: Slight softening as SA unemployment ticked up to 2.7% in November, vs 2.6% in October. Rationale: employment detail shows second straight monthly increase in jobless rate. [tradingeconomics](https://tradingeconomics.com/south-korea/unemployment-rate)
- US: No fresh official CPI in the past week; focus moves to BEA PCE update (Dec 23) and holiday-thinned docket. Rationale: schedule shifts post-shutdown and nowcasting fills gap until PCE. [clevelandfed](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting)

Playbook — trades, hedges, and risk controls
- Duration/curve
  - USD rates: Maintain neutral-to-modestly long duration into PCE; add on any upside surprise to real yields given disinflation trend resilience. [bea](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index)
  - Gilts: Tilt long duration tactically after the UK CPI downside surprise; fade steepening risk unless wage data re-accelerates. [reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-inflation-falls-32-before-bank-england-rate-decision-2025-12-17/)
  - JGBs: Keep modest short duration bias or tactical steepeners around BoJ normalization risk; volatility hedges advisable. [fxstreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/japans-national-cpi-rises-29-yoy-in-november-core-cpi-climbs-as-expected-202512182331)
- FX tilts
  - Short GBP on rallies near UK disinflation and potential dovish BoE bias; prefer EUR/GBP topside only selectively given Euro services stickiness. [tradingeconomics](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi)
  - JPY: Maintain optionality (long gamma or call spreads) into any BoJ-related normalization headlines; use dips to accumulate JPY selectively. [fxstreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/japans-national-cpi-rises-29-yoy-in-november-core-cpi-climbs-as-expected-202512182331)
  - CNH: Maintain cautious stance; weaker November data argues for policy-easing risk; favor USD/CNH support on dips. [cnbc](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/15/chinas-november-retail-sales-industrial-production-fixed-asset-investment.html)
- Equities
  - Overweight defensives and quality growth in UK on disinflation plus prospective policy tailwind; underweight domestic cyclicals in China until demand stabilizes; prefer exporters. [reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-factory-output-retail-sales-weaken-november-2025-12-15/)
  - Japan: Balance exporters with rate-sensitive domestics; hedge equity beta given policy path uncertainty. [fxstreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/japans-national-cpi-rises-29-yoy-in-november-core-cpi-climbs-as-expected-202512182331)
  - Eurozone: Neutral headline but cautious on services-cost pressure; favor firms with pricing power. [tradingeconomics](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi)
- Credit
  - Prefer higher quality IG over HY given late-year liquidity and mixed China growth signals; in EM Asia credit, favor sovereign/quasi-sovereign with policy support. [cnbc](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/15/chinas-november-retail-sales-industrial-production-fixed-asset-investment.html)
- Hedges
  - Event risk: US PCE (Dec 23) and any BoJ remarks; use short-dated options in USTs, JGBs, USD/JPY. [bea](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index)

- Liquidity checklist
  - Size smaller due to holiday-thin markets flagged for Dec 22–28; stagger entries; widen stop buffers. [kiplinger](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/economy/this-weeks-economic-calendar)
