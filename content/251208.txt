Direct answer: Over the past week, headline official releases painted a mixed but stable macro backdrop: Eurozone activity firmed on PMIs while German factory orders rose; US official data flow remains constrained by the prior shutdown ahead of the December 16 jobs report; Japan’s household spending weakened; UK October GDP is due December 12; China’s latest official inflation data are for October; Korea’s labor data remain benign with a low jobless rate.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]

## Past week highlights
- US: Limited new official prints due to earlier shutdown; BLS set to publish November Employment Situation on Dec 16; ADP reported a private payroll drop on Dec 3.[7][8]
- Eurozone: Composite PMI signaled the fastest expansion in 30 months in November; German October factory orders +1.5% m/m.[6][1]
- UK: Next official monthly GDP (October) scheduled Dec 12.[5][9]
- China: Most recent official CPI/PPI are October (CPI +0.2% y/y; PPI -2.1% y/y); November PMIs were released Dec 1.[4][10]
- Japan: Household spending fell 3.0% y/y in October.[2]
- Korea: Unemployment at 2.6% in October (latest official).[3]

## What changed vs last week
- Eurozone growth pulse: Meaningfully firmer as November PMI showed the fastest activity in 30 months, indicating momentum improvement versus prior weeks’ moderate pace. Rationale: stronger services offset manufacturing drag.[1]
- Germany external/domestic mix: Orders +1.5% m/m in October driven by domestic strength and large transport equipment; indicates incremental improvement in capex pipeline versus the prior month’s already-revised gain.[6]
- Japan consumption: Turned weaker with October household spending -3.0% y/y, the sharpest drop since Jan 2024, signaling a deterioration versus September.[2]
- US labor readings: No new BLS hard data; ADP showed a notable private payroll contraction, tilting near-term labor tone softer versus the prior week.[8]
- UK growth: No new outturns; focus shifts to Dec 12 GDP release, so assessment unchanged pending data.[5]
- China inflation/growth: No fresh official CPI/PPI in the week; stance unchanged pending November CPI/PPI due this week.[10]

## Date and upcoming week
- Date: 2025-12-08 (KST).  
- Key events this week (indicative):
  - US: FOMC decision (Dec 11–12 window referenced in week-ahead coverage) and BLS November Employment Situation on Dec 16; JOLTS/other delayed prints referenced by calendars.[11][12]
  - Eurozone/DE: Germany final inflation (Nov), industrial production; Euro area data flow normal.[11]
  - UK: Monthly GDP, production (Oct) on Dec 12.[9][5]
  - China: November CPI/PPI; November trade balance.[10][11]
  - Japan: Q3 GDP final; November PPI.[11]
  - Korea: November unemployment this week per regional calendars.[11]

## Risk backdrop by pillar
- Growth: Eurozone PMIs point to firmer near-term growth; Germany orders suggest capex pipeline support; Japan consumption weakens; US assessment constrained by data delays.[7][1][2][6]
- Inflation: Eurozone inflation remains close to 2% per recent reads; China’s last CPI +0.2% y/y and PPI -2.1% y/y; US official CPI last published September remains around 3% core; updates due in coming weeks.[13][14][4]
- Labor: US hard data pending; ADP shows softening; Korea unemployment low at 2.6% (Oct).[3][8]
- Housing: UK housing to be informed via monthly GDP/production this week; US housing flow light in the week, with sector commentary noting modest existing sales previously.[15][5]
- External/trade: Germany orders showed domestic strength with softer non-euro foreign orders; China trade due this week to update external pulse.[6][11]
- Credit/financial conditions: Market focus on FOMC; week-ahead sources flag broad central bank meetings and benign eurozone price pressures supportive of steady policy.[1][11]

## 7-day playbook
- Rates/duration and curve
  - Duration: Maintain moderate-long duration bias into major central bank week given softer Japan consumption, benign eurozone inflation dynamics, and US labor uncertainty from ADP.[8][2][1]
  - Curve: Favor mild 2s10s steepening expressions in US/EU as policy risk leans to cuts in 2026 while growth is mixed; avoid heavy front-end shorts pre-FOMC.[1][11]

- FX tilts
  - EUR: Neutral to modestly constructive near term on firmer PMI momentum, but avoid chasing given services-driven inflation stickiness risk.[1]
  - USD: Neutral into FOMC and US jobs; elevated event risk suggests lower conviction.[7][11]
  - JPY: Maintain defensive long bias via options given weak domestic spending and upcoming GDP/PPI, with BoJ policy optionality ahead.[2][11]
  - KRW: Neutral; await Korea labor update and China CPI/PPI/trade as key drivers.[10][11]

- Equities
  - Sector tilts: Overweight quality defensives and services-exposed EU names benefiting from PMI resilience; underweight Japan domestic cyclicals sensitive to consumption; keep US tilt toward cash-generative growth until labor clarity returns.[8][2][1]
  - Europe industrials: Selectively positive where order books tied to transport equipment strength in Germany, acknowledging volatility from large orders.[6]

- Credit
  - Quality: Favor IG over HY near term given mixed growth and event risk; HY beta less attractive until US labor clarity and China prints confirm stabilization.[2][8]
  - Europe corporates: Supportive on improved activity but avoid lower-quality manufacturers with export exposure given softer foreign orders in German data.[6]

- Hedges and optionality
  - Into event-heavy week, use:
    - Equity downside via put spreads on broad indices.[11]
    - Rates vol: Own limited-tenor payer swaptions to hedge upside inflation surprises from China CPI or euro services prices.[10][1]
    - FX: EURUSD strangles around key central bank windows; USDJPY downside calls (JPY calls) for risk-off/BoJ optionality.[11]

- Liquidity checklist
  - Pre-position: Reduce gross leverage ahead of FOMC and UK GDP print.[5][11]
  - Stagger orders and widen limits around data drop times flagged in calendars.[12][9]
  - Maintain cash buffer for post-event rebalancing; confirm margin headroom with higher intraday vol expected.[11]

Notes on sources: Where possible, changes and schedules are anchored to official or widely used sources including BLS, Destatis, ONS, NBS of China, and recognized week-ahead calendars; several US series remain disrupted/timed due to the prior federal shutdown and revised publication dates.[12][5][7][10][6][11]
