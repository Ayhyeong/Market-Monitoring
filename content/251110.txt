## 4) Playbook (Carried Forward, No Data‑Driven Adjustment)

### Hedges

- Maintain short‑dated volatility hedges into upcoming CPI‑style releases.
    
- Maintain equity downside hedges sized to implied volatility conditions.
    

### Duration / Curve

- **USD duration:** Slight long bias ahead of inflation releases; be ready to reduce if inflation surprises high.
    
- **GBP duration:** Slight short bias until UK labor/inflation confirms improvement.
    
- **EUR duration:** Neutral‑to‑slight long.
    

### FX Tilts

- Modest **long USD vs GBP**, given persistent UK macro downside risk.
    
- **EUR/GBP:** neutral‑to‑slight long EUR.
    
- **JPY/KRW:** maintain neutral positioning until data arrives.
    

### Equity Sector Tilts

- Overweight **defensives** (Healthcare, Staples).
    
- Underweight **cyclicals** tied to trade and housing.
    

### Credit Quality Stance

- Prefer **investment‑grade** over high‑yield.
    
- Keep credit duration moderate.
    

### Liquidity Checklist

- Maintain cash buffer.
    
- Confirm margin and collateral sufficiency.
    
- Avoid new leverage until key inflation data is released.
