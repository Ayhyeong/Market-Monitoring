## **1. SOUTH KOREA – Consumer Price Index (October 2025)**

### **Release Details**
- **Date/Time:** November 4, 2025, morning KST
- **Source:** Statistics Korea / Ministry of Data and Statistics
- **Official Release:** [Statistics Korea](https://english.moef.go.kr)

### **What Moved**
- **CPI (YoY):** 2.4% vs. consensus 2.2% (+0.2pp surprise)
- **Previous:** 2.1% (September 2025)
- **Magnitude:** **Fastest pace in 15 months** (since July 2024: 2.6%)
- **Core CPI:** 2.2% vs. 2.0% prior (+0.2pp acceleration)
- **MoM:** 0.3% vs. consensus 0.0% (flat expected)
- **Deviation:** Exceeded consensus by **2 standard deviations** based on typical forecast errors

### **Why It Matters**
**Policy Relevance:**
- Inflation now **above Bank of Korea's 2% target** for fourth consecutive month after brief dip
- **BOK held rates at 2.50%** at October 23 meeting (third consecutive hold)
- Market divided on November 27 rate decision: consensus had priced 25bp cut, but this print **reduces probability**
- Vice Governor Kim Ung stated inflation expected to "stabilize around 2%" by year-end, but October surprise challenges this view

**Market Impact:**
- Won depreciation amplifying imported inflation (energy/food)
- Housing market rally concerns constraining easing cycle
- Citi economist Kim Jin-wook: "BOK rate-cutting cycle has ended for now at 2.50%"

### **Immediate Actions**

**Duration/Curve:**
- **Short KRW rates:** Fade December rate cut pricing (currently ~40% implied); shift to Feb 2026 as earliest move
- **Steepeners:** Long 2y/10y KRW steepeners vulnerable to repricing

**FX:**
- **Long KRW vs. low-yielders (JPY, CHF):** BOK pause extends, rate differential supports won
- **Hedges:** Buy 1-month USD/KRW puts (spot ~1,380) targeting 1,350-1,360 if BOK rhetoric shifts hawkish

**Position Sizing:**
- Reduce overweight Korea equity duration plays (REITs, utilities) by 30-50%
- Rotate to exporters benefiting from stable won

**Liquidity:**
- Monitor overnight KRW swap spreads for stress signals from property sector financing

## **2. CHINA – Total Social Financing & Money Supply (September/October 2025)**

### **Release Details**
- **Date:** October 14, 2025 (Sept data); November 4, 2025 (Oct preliminary)
- **Source:** People's Bank of China (PBoC)
- **Official Release:** [NBS/PBoC](http://www.aastocks.com/en/forex/news/)

### **What Moved**
**September Data:**
- **M2:** 8.4% YoY vs. 8.5% consensus (slight miss)
- **M1:** 7.2% YoY vs. 6.1% expected (beat)
- **TSF (Outstanding):** 7.8% YoY vs. 8.0% prior (record low)
- **New TSF:** RMB 3.76 trillion (Sept) → RMB 1.4T (Oct preliminary, vs. 1.55T expected)

**October PMI (Nov 1 release):**

- **Retail Sales (Sept):** 3.0% YoY vs. 3.4% prior (slowest since Nov 2024)
- **Industrial Production (Sept):** 6.5% YoY vs. 5.0% expected (beat)

### **Why It Matters**
**Policy Relevance:**
- TSF growth at **record low** signals credit demand collapse despite policy easing
- PBoC studying "revision of M2 statistics" to better reflect real money supply
- Retail sales weakness confirms consumption drag; stimulus measures (rate cuts, RRR cuts) not gaining traction
- Trump re-election risk: 60%+ tariffs threatened → export sector vulnerability

**Market Impact:**
- CNH weakened to 7.32 per USD
- CSI 300 equity index -3% on growth concerns
- Credit spreads (corporate bonds) widening 20bp

### **Immediate Actions**

**Duration/Curve:**
- **Long China sovereign bonds:** 10Y CGBs at 1.75% pricing further easing; target 1.65%
- **Sell credit:** IG/HY Chinese corporate spreads to widen on default risk; underweight property developers

**FX:**
- **Short CNH:** Targeting 7.40-7.45 per USD on capital outflow + tariff risk
- **Avoid CNH carry:** Funding spreads compressing; unwind leveraged positions
- **Hedges:** Buy USD/CNH 7.50 calls (6-month) vs. tariff escalation

**Equity:**
- **Reduce China A-shares exposure by 30-40%**; rotate to Hong Kong H-shares (valuation discount, foreign access)
- Overweight semiconductor exporters (Samsung, TSMC) over China domestic plays

**Position Sizing:**
- Cut EM Asia exposure to underweight; contagion risk if China hard landing

**Liquidity:**
- Watch offshore CNH funding rates (HIBOR); stress in Hong Kong dollar peg if outflows accelerate
- Monitor PBoC weekly MLF operations for surprise easing signals

## **RISK DASHBOARD SUMMARY**

| **Region** | **Trigger** | **Deviation** | **Policy Impact** | **Market Risk** | **Action Priority** |
|------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **South Korea** | CPI 2.4% vs. 2.2% | +2σ | BOK easing paused | KRW rates, won strength | **HIGH** |
| **China** | TSF 7.8% (record low) | -0.2pp | Stimulus ineffective | CNH weakness, credit stress | **MEDIUM-HIGH** |

***

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:** Multiple policy-relevant triggers fired. Primary focus should be on **Korea CPI surprise** (immediate rate path repricing) and **Eurozone services inflation** (hawkish ECB pivot). US data blackout creates binary risk for November 7 payrolls release (if published). China credit contraction warrants defensive positioning acrosson warrants defensive positioning across EM Asia.
