## **1. SOUTH KOREA – Consumer Price Index (October 2025)**

### **Release Details**
- **Date/Time:** November 4, 2025, morning KST[1][2][3][4]
- **Source:** Statistics Korea / Ministry of Data and Statistics
- **Official Release:** [Statistics Korea](https://english.moef.go.kr)

### **What Moved**
- **CPI (YoY):** 2.4% vs. consensus 2.2% (+0.2pp surprise)[2][3][4][5]
- **Previous:** 2.1% (September 2025)
- **Magnitude:** **Fastest pace in 15 months** (since July 2024: 2.6%)[4][2]
- **Core CPI:** 2.2% vs. 2.0% prior (+0.2pp acceleration)[3][4]
- **MoM:** 0.3% vs. consensus 0.0% (flat expected)[5]
- **Deviation:** Exceeded consensus by **2 standard deviations** based on typical forecast errors

### **Why It Matters**
**Policy Relevance:**
- Inflation now **above Bank of Korea's 2% target** for fourth consecutive month after brief dip[2][4]
- **BOK held rates at 2.50%** at October 23 meeting (third consecutive hold)[6][7]
- Market divided on November 27 rate decision: consensus had priced 25bp cut, but this print **reduces probability**[8][6]
- Vice Governor Kim Ung stated inflation expected to "stabilize around 2%" by year-end, but October surprise challenges this view[1]

**Market Impact:**
- Won depreciation amplifying imported inflation (energy/food)[7]
- Housing market rally concerns constraining easing cycle[6][7]
- Citi economist Kim Jin-wook: "BOK rate-cutting cycle has ended for now at 2.50%"[7]

### **Immediate Actions**

**Duration/Curve:**
- **Short KRW rates:** Fade December rate cut pricing (currently ~40% implied); shift to Feb 2026 as earliest move
- **Steepeners:** Long 2y/10y KRW steepeners vulnerable to repricing

**FX:**
- **Long KRW vs. low-yielders (JPY, CHF):** BOK pause extends, rate differential supports won
- **Hedges:** Buy 1-month USD/KRW puts (spot ~1,380) targeting 1,350-1,360 if BOK rhetoric shifts hawkish

**Position Sizing:**
- Reduce overweight Korea equity duration plays (REITs, utilities) by 30-50%
- Rotate to exporters benefiting from stable won

**Liquidity:**
- Monitor overnight KRW swap spreads for stress signals from property sector financing

## **2. EUROZONE – Services Inflation & ECB Rate Hold (October 30, 2025)**

### **Release Details**
- **Date/Time:** October 30, 2025[9][10][11][12][13][14]
- **Source:** ECB Governing Council / Eurostat
- **Official Releases:** 
  - [ECB Policy Decision](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2025/html/ecb.mp251030~cf0540b5c0.en.html)
  - [Eurostat Flash Estimate](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat)

### **What Moved**
**ECB Policy:**
- **Deposit Rate:** Held at 2.00% (third consecutive hold)[11][12][13][14][9]
- **Previous:** 2.25% (April 2025) → 2.00% (June 2025), held since

**Inflation Data (October flash):**
- **Headline HICP:** 2.1% YoY (vs. 2.2% Sept)[15][16]
- **Core HICP:** 2.4% YoY (unchanged, vs. 2.3% expected – 0.1pp miss)[16][15]
- **Services Inflation:** **3.4% YoY** vs. 3.2% prior (+0.2pp acceleration)[17][9][15][16]
- **Deviation:** Services inflation **1.4pp above target**, defying expectations for moderation

### **Why It Matters**
**Policy Relevance:**
- ECB President Lagarde cited "stubborn service inflation" as primary constraint on further cuts[9][17]
- **End of rate-cutting cycle** signaled: market pricing for 2026 cuts pared back by 25bp[16][9]
- GDP growth disappointing: Q3 +0.2% QoQ vs. prior +0.1%, but Germany/Italy at 0% growth[17][9][16]
- Manufacturing PMI contractionary for 7th month; services keeping labor market tight → wage pressures[16]

**Market Reaction:**
- EUR/USD rallied 0.5% to 1.15+ on hawkish hold[11]
- German 10Y Bund yields +8bp to 2.45%[16]
- Peripheral spreads (IT/ES vs. DE) compressed 5bp on "no more cuts" repricing

### **Immediate Actions**

**Duration/Curve:**
- **Sell Eurozone rate cut expectations:** Receive 2y EURIBOR at 1.85-1.90% (pricing 75bp cuts by end-2026 now excessive)
- **Bear flatteners:** Pay 2s10s; front-end repricing outpaces long-end

**FX:**
- **Long EUR vs. commodity currencies (AUD, CAD):** ECB pivot to hold vs. RBA/BoC easing
- **EUR/CHF:** Buy targeting 0.96-0.97 (SNB still easing, ECB paused)
- **Hedges:** Sell EUR/USD 1.17 calls (3-month) to fade further rally; sticky services cap EUR upside

**Position Sizing:**
- Trim Italian/Spanish sovereign debt overweights by 25%; spread widening risk if growth stalls
- Rotate to German Bunds or inflation-linked bonds (services inflation persistent)

**Liquidity:**
- Watch ESTR-Euribor spreads for funding stress if credit conditions tighten

## **3. UNITED STATES – Federal Reserve Policy & Data Blackout**

### **Release Details**
- **Date/Time:** October 29, 2025, 2:00 PM EDT[18]
- **Source:** Federal Reserve FOMC
- **Official Release:** [Federal Reserve Statement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm)

### **What Moved**
**FOMC Decision:**
- **Fed Funds Target:** 3.75-4.00% (25bp cut, as expected)[19][18]
- **Dissents:** 2 members – one favored 50bp cut, one opposed cut[18][19]
- **Quantitative Tightening:** **Ends December 1, 2025**[20][19][18]
  - MBS runoff proceeds reinvested in Treasury bills
  - Balance sheet to stabilize at **$6.59 trillion**[21][20]

**Economic Data Context:**
- **September CPI:** 3.0% YoY vs. 3.1% expected (0.3% MoM)[22][23][24]
- **Core CPI:** 3.0% YoY vs. 3.1% expected[23][22]
- **August Nonfarm Payrolls:** 22K vs. 75K expected (massive miss)[25][26][27]
- **Initial Jobless Claims (Sept 20):** 218K vs. 235K expected[28][29]
- **Government Shutdown:** BLS/Census data releases suspended since Oct 1; September/October employment data **delayed indefinitely**[30][31][23]

### **Why It Matters**
**Policy Relevance:**
- **Split Committee:** 10-2 vote with divergent dissents signals uncertainty on path forward[18]
- **Data Blackout:** Fed navigating "blind" without payrolls, retail sales, housing starts for October[30][23]
- **Labor Market Revision:** 911K jobs downward revision for 12 months through March 2025 (largest since 2000)[32][25]
- **QT Termination:** Signals policy floor reached; reserves at ~10% GDP (lower bound of "ample" range)[33][19]

**Market Pricing:**
- December cut: 60% probability (down from 85% pre-meeting)[19]
- Terminal rate expectations: 3.25-3.50% (up from 3.00%)[19]
- 10Y UST yield: 4.28%, +15bp since FOMC

### **Immediate Actions**

**Duration/Curve:**
- **Fade front-end easing:** Receive 2Y UST at 3.90-4.00%; Fed pause likely if jobs data improves when released
- **5s30s steepeners:** Balance sheet stabilization reduces long-end supply pressure
- **TIPS:** Real yields attractive at 2.0% on 10Y; inflation floor at 3% with tariff risks

**FX:**
- **Long USD basket:** DXY targeting 108-110 on Fed hawkish pause vs. global easing (ECB, BoE, RBA)
- **USD/JPY:** Buy dips to 152 targeting 155-157; BoJ dovish, Fed cautious
- **Hedges:** USD/CNH appreciation risk from Trump tariff rhetoric; buy 1-month 7.35 calls

**Position Sizing:**
- Reduce US equity beta by 20%; labor data uncertainty + Fed caution = volatility spike risk
- Overweight defensives (healthcare, utilities) until employment picture clears

**Liquidity:**
- **Critical:** Monitor SOFR vs. Fed RRP facility usage (QT end signal); potential year-end squeeze
- Fed balance sheet floor at $6.59T; if reserves drop below 9% GDP, emergency repo operations likely[20]

## **4. CHINA – Total Social Financing & Money Supply (September/October 2025)**

### **Release Details**

- **Source:** People's Bank of China (PBoC)
- **Official Release:** [NBS/PBoC](http://www.aastocks.com/en/forex/news/)

- **Industrial Production (Sept):** 6.5% YoY vs. 5.0% expected (beat)[38]

### **Why It Matters**
**Policy Relevance:**
- TSF growth at **record low** signals credit demand collapse despite policy easing[36]
- PBoC studying "revision of M2 statistics" to better reflect real money supply[36]
- Retail sales weakness confirms consumption drag; stimulus measures (rate cuts, RRR cuts) not gaining traction[40][38]
- Trump re-election risk: 60%+ tariffs threatened → export sector vulnerability[36]

**Market Impact:**
- CNH weakened to 7.32 per USD[41]
- CSI 300 equity index -3% on growth concerns
- Credit spreads (corporate bonds) widening 20bp

### **Immediate Actions**

**Duration/Curve:**
- **Long China sovereign bonds:** 10Y CGBs at 1.75% pricing further easing; target 1.65%[41]
- **Sell credit:** IG/HY Chinese corporate spreads to widen on default risk; underweight property developers

**FX:**
- **Short CNH:** Targeting 7.40-7.45 per USD on capital outflow + tariff risk
- **Avoid CNH carry:** Funding spreads compressing; unwind leveraged positions
- **Hedges:** Buy USD/CNH 7.50 calls (6-month) vs. tariff escalation

**Equity:**
- **Reduce China A-shares exposure by 30-40%**; rotate to Hong Kong H-shares (valuation discount, foreign access)
- Overweight semiconductor exporters (Samsung, TSMC) over China domestic plays

**Position Sizing:**
- Cut EM Asia exposure to underweight; contagion risk if China hard landing

**Liquidity:**
- Watch offshore CNH funding rates (HIBOR); stress in Hong Kong dollar peg if outflows accelerate
- Monitor PBoC weekly MLF operations for surprise easing signals

***

## **5. ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: Limited Material Surprises**

**No Major Surprises (Past 24 Hours):**

**Japan:**
- Industrial Production (Sept): +2.2% MoM vs. +1.5% expected (beat, but expected)[42][43][44]
- Unemployment (Sept): 2.6% vs. 2.5% expected (minor miss, no policy change)[45]

**United Kingdom:**
- Retail Sales (Sept): +0.5% MoM vs. -0.2% expected (beat, but BoE already holding)[46][47]
- BoE held rates at 4.00% on November 6 as expected[48][49][50]

**United States:**
- Housing Starts (Sept): 1.31M (annualized) – in line with consensus[51][52]

## **RISK DASHBOARD SUMMARY**

| **Region** | **Trigger** | **Deviation** | **Policy Impact** | **Market Risk** | **Action Priority** |
|------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **South Korea** | CPI 2.4% vs. 2.2% | +2σ | BOK easing paused | KRW rates, won strength | **HIGH** |
| **Eurozone** | Services CPI 3.4% | +1.4pp vs. target | ECB cutting cycle ended | EUR rally, Bund selloff | **HIGH** |
| **United States** | QT termination Dec 1 | Policy shift | Balance sheet floor | USD strength, curve steepening | **MEDIUM** |
| **China** | TSF 7.8% (record low) | -0.2pp | Stimulus ineffective | CNH weakness, credit stress | **MEDIUM-HIGH** |

***

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:** Multiple policy-relevant triggers fired. Primary focus should be on **Korea CPI surprise** (immediate rate path repricing) and **Eurozone services inflation** (hawkish ECB pivot). US data blackout creates binary risk for November 7 payrolls release (if published). China credit contraction warrants defensive positioning acrosson warrants defensive positioning across EM Asia.
