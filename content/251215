## Date
- Monday, December 15, 2025 (KST).[3]

## Past week: key official releases and what changed
- United States
  - Inflation data timing: October CPI was canceled; November CPI was rescheduled to Dec 18, keeping the market flying partially blind into the Fed cut last week. This is unchanged from prior guidance, but now imminent.[9][10]
  - Policy context: The Fed cut 25 bps and highlighted labor cooling; markets refocus on incoming CPI/NFP this week. This is a change versus the prior week, when the cut was only expected.[11]

- Eurozone
  - Activity: Composite PMI previously accelerated; manufacturing PMI finalized at 49.6 in November (a 5‑month low), underscoring a services-led upswing with manufacturing still contracting. This is marginally softer than flash and weaker than October, so directionally a slight negative vs last week.[2][1]

- China
  - Prices: November CPI rose 0.7% y/y while PPI fell 2.2% y/y, extending factory‑gate deflation; both confirmed mid‑week per NBS. This is broadly consistent with expectations and maintains the disinflation/deflation split—little change vs last week’s narrative.[6][12][13]
  - External: November trade data pointed to ongoing export resilience and a record goods surplus at the annual level; the exports narrative is incrementally firmer than a week ago.[14][15]

- Japan
  - Sentiment: Reuters Tankan manufacturers index fell to +10 in December from +17 in November, indicating softer momentum heading into potential BoJ action; that’s a meaningful deterioration from last week’s stronger November reading.[2]

- United Kingdom
  - Week-ahead focus flagged PMIs and labor/inflation prints; no major surprise releases last week. The setup leans toward cooling domestic demand and potential further easing; little change week‑over‑week.[16][3]

- Korea
  - Labor: Unemployment rose to 2.7% in November (sa), the second consecutive monthly increase; that’s a deterioration versus last week’s 2.6% October reference.[17]

## Rationale for “meaningful change” flags
- US: From “anticipated” to “delivered” Fed cut; November CPI now imminent after reschedule—policy stance became concrete while data vacuum remains until Dec 18.[4][10]
- Eurozone: Final manufacturing PMI dipped to 49.6 (below flash), modestly weakening the goods outlook versus a week ago’s mixed PMI signals.[18][3]
- China: Persistence of PPI deflation at −2.2% and CPI at 0.7% sustains the same policy/credit easing bias—no material shift versus prior week.[12][13][6]
- Japan: Reuters Tankan step‑down to +10 marks a notable setback versus last week’s strong +17 reading.[2]
- Korea: Jobless rate tick-up to 2.7% is a small but notable weakening in labor conditions vs last week’s level.[17]

## Next week: key event calendar
- United States: November NFP (delayed) Dec 16; November CPI Dec 18; ongoing Fed speakers post‑cut. These are the focal points for inflation and labor re‑calibration.[19][11]
- Eurozone: Flash PMIs and industrial production details feeding into the ECB hold narrative.[18]
- China: November CPI/PPI already out; watch credit (TSF) and loans cadence from the same data window; trade momentum follow‑through in high‑frequency.[13][14]
- Japan: BoJ meeting watch and Tankan/PMIs in focus; machinery/orders flow and sentiment data on deck.[20][3]
- UK: Flash PMIs; labor and inflation updates to frame BoE easing path.[8][16]
- Korea: Labor printed; watch subsequent November activity/trade reads and any BOK commentary.[21][17]

## Risk backdrop by pillar
- Growth: Eurozone activity improving but goods remain soft; Japan sentiment slipped; China exports resilient but domestic demand lagging; US growth assessment hinges on delayed CPI/NFP. Net growth tone slightly softer vs last week due to Japan and EZ manufacturing.[15][3][4][2]
- Inflation: US prints delayed until Dec 18; Eurozone near‑target; China CPI subdued with persistent PPI deflation; Japan inflation watch continues into BoJ; UK disinflation trend in focus. Inflation risk skew modestly lower ex‑US, pending US data.[10][6][13][16][18]
- Labor: US NFP incoming; Korea unemployment up to 2.7%; Eurozone job creation slowed in PMI; Japan mood points to softer hiring ahead. Labor momentum is cooling at the margin.[5][11][17][2]
- Housing: No major fresh official prints in the week; US outlook awaits CPI/shelter detail; China property drag persists as per macro commentary. Stable‑to‑soft.[7][4]
- External/trade: China surplus narrative firmed; Eurozone goods soft; Japan exposed to external demand and currency; US trade not in focus this week. Slight positive from China exports.[3][15][2]
- Credit conditions: China’s easing bias reinforced by deflationary PPI; US policy cut delivered; Europe steady; Japan policy normalization risk; net liquidity slightly easier globally.[6][11][18]

## Updated multi-asset playbook
- Hedges
  - Equity downside via index puts into US CPI/NFP window; add event-risk collars in Japan given BoJ uncertainty.[11][20]
  - Tail hedges for Eurozone cyclicals given manufacturing softness.[1][2]
- Rates: duration and curve
  - Duration: Maintain modest long duration bias in USTs into CPI, scaling tactically around the release; stay neutral‑to‑long duration in core Euro govvies given subdued goods inflation.[10][1]
  - Curve: Favor 2s10s steepeners in the US post‑cut with cooling labor; keep mild bull‑flattening bias in Eurozone if PMIs disappoint.[11][2]
- FX tilts
  - USD: Neutral to slightly defensive into CPI/NFP; data surprise risk two‑sided.[19][10]
  - EUR: Cautious long‑EUR on services resilience but cap size due to weak manufacturing.[3][18]
  - JPY: Prefer owning some JPY optionality into BoJ and softer Tankan; spot bias modestly stronger JPY if BoJ hawkish.[5][20]
  - CNY: Stable‑to‑firm on surplus/flow but macro remains disinflationary; keep balanced stance.[15][6]
  - GBP: Neutral awaiting PMIs/inflation; domestic demand soft.[16]
- Equities: sector tilts
  - Overweight: US quality growth/tech with duration support; Eurozone services‑exposed defensives.[4][18]
  - Underweight: Eurozone cyclicals/industrials tied to weak manufacturing; Japan autos/industrials if BoJ tightens and Tankan softens.[20][2][3]
  - China/HK: Select exporters/AI supply chain exposure; avoid deep property beta given persistent PPI deflation and housing drag.[7][15]
- Credit stance
  - Favor higher‑quality IG over HY given cooling labor and pending US inflation prints; in Asia, prefer China SOE/quasi‑SOE over private developers amid property weakness.[6][11]
- Liquidity checklist (next 7–10 days)
  - US CPI/NFP dates locked and hedges in place; reduce gross ahead of prints; pre‑fund collateral buffers.[10][19]
  - Monitor BoJ outcome; keep JPY and rates optionality live through decision.[20]
  - Track Eurozone PMIs; trim cyclical beta if manufacturing slips further.[1][2]
  - China credit and loans data follow‑through; reassess CNY and China equity exposure on TSF surprise.[13][14]
