## Past Week – Official Macro Releases & Meaningful Changes

### United States

- Due to the extended 2025 United States federal government shutdown, many key U.S. datasets (such as the jobs report, CPI, and weekly jobless claims) were delayed. [Axios+2SWBC Blogs+2](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/10/government-shutdown-gdp-cpi)
    
    - **Change vs last week**: The absence of data itself is a meaningful change — the shutdown interruption means market participants must rely on alternative indicators or expect a “data dump” once normal reporting resumes.
        
- Some non‑official data indicated: the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Services Prices Paid index rose to ~70.0, its highest since October 2022, suggesting a firming of services inflation. [BNP Paribas Economic Research+1](https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/html/en-US/EcoNews-10-November-2025-11/10/2025%2C52976)
    
    - **Rationale**: Elevated services inflation increases risk of monetary policy remaining restrictive despite weak labour data.
        

### Eurozone

- The composite PMI for October rose to ~52.5 (from ~51.5) — highest since May 2023. [BNP Paribas Economic Research](https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/html/en-US/EcoNews-10-November-2025-11/10/2025%2C52976)
    
    - **Change vs last week**: A clear uptick in business activity suggests slightly improved growth momentum in the Eurozone.
        
- Producer prices in the Eurozone declined ~0.2 % y/y in September, reflecting contained inflationary pressure in goods. [BNP Paribas Economic Research](https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/html/en-US/EcoNews-10-November-2025-11/10/2025%2C52976)
    
    - **Rationale**: While growth indicators improved, inflation pressures remain moderate, reducing urgency of imminent tightening.
        

### China

- Exports in China unexpectedly fell ~1.1 % y/y in October, while imports rose ~1.0 % — a notable external drag. [BNP Paribas Economic Research](https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/html/en-US/EcoNews-10-November-2025-11/10/2025%2C52976)
    
    - **Change vs last week**: A deterioration in external/trade conditions in China, signalling weaker demand abroad and potential headwinds for growth.
        
- Monthly activity‑data (industrial, retail) are due soon, signalling risk of further softness. [ABN AMRO Bank+1](https://www.abnamro.com/research/en/our-research/the-week-ahead-10-14-november-2025)
    

### Japan

- Data show real wages remained negative (\~‑1.4% y/y in September) and household spending slowed (\~+1.8% y/y) per recent update. [BNP Paribas Economic Research](https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/html/en-US/EcoNews-10-November-2025-11/10/2025%2C52976)
    
    - **Change vs last week**: Continued weak labour/income signals support soft growth‑momentum narrative for Japan.
        

### United Kingdom

- The Bank of England held rates at 4.0% in a split vote (5‑4). [BNP Paribas Economic Research+1](https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/html/en-US/EcoNews-10-November-2025-11/10/2025%2C52976)
    
    - **Change vs last week**: The split decision signals growing divergence among policymakers on outlook; upcoming labour/growth data will be closely watched for the next move.
        
- House‑prices showed ~+1.3% y/y increase in October per Halifax index — highest since January. [BNP Paribas Economic Research](https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/html/en-US/EcoNews-10-November-2025-11/10/2025%2C52976)
    
    - **Rationale**: A moderate rebound in housing could reduce one drag on the UK economy, but not yet strong enough to shift macro‑outlook.
        

### Korea

- No major fresh high‑profile credit/housing/official growth release flagged this week in readily accessible sources.
    
    - **Change vs last week**: Neutral by default — underlying risks remain (global trade, regional growth) but no new publication to shift outlook.

## Playbook – Updated Actions

**Hedges**

- Maintain event‑hedge for U.S. inflation data: short‑dated rate volatility, inflation swaps.
    
- Consider FX hedge for USD vs GBP and EUR given upcoming UK data risk and Eurozone growth improvement.
    

**Duration / Curve Stance**

- USD: Slight long duration ahead of CPI; but prepare to shorten if inflation surprise is high.
    
- EUR: Moderate long duration given improving growth and contained inflation.
    
- GBP: Short duration bias until UK labour/growth data provide clearer support.
    
- Curve: Watch for front‑end steepening if inflation surprise benign; flattening if surprise high.
    

**FX Tilts**

- Long USD vs GBP given UK labour/growth uncertainty.
    
- Neutral to slight long EUR vs GBP, reflecting Eurozone growth pickup.
    
- Keep JPY and KRW neutrally positioned until clear signals.
    

**Equity Sector Tilts**

- Overweight defensives (Healthcare, Consumer Staples) given inflation risk and growth ambiguity.
    
- Underweight heavily trade‑exposed/cyclical sectors (Materials, Industrials) given external/trade softness and regional growth weakness.
    
- Consider relative overweight in Eurozone export‑light sectors (domestic services) given domestic momentum pickup.
    

**Credit Quality Stance**

- Prefer investment grade (IG) credit over high yield (HY) until inflation/growth clarity emerges.
    
- Monitor China credit/trade signals for emerging‑market credit stress; keep EM credit exposure modest.
    
- In U.S. bank credit, maintain current exposures but stay alert to any liquidity/flow stress from data revisions.
    

**Liquidity Checklist**

- Ensure adequate cash buffer ahead of major data events (especially U.S. CPI, UK GDP).
    
- Confirm margin/collateral availability for derivatives hedges (inflation swaps, options).
    
- Avoid over‑leveraging until clearer macro signals emerge.
    
- Keep stance flexible to de‑risk quickly if inflation surprises significantly or growth drops sharply.
