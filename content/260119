**Past Week's Macro Releases (Jan 12-19, 2026)**

Key official releases focused on inflation, growth proxies, labor, and trade, with limited housing, external, or credit data. US CPI rose 0.3% MoM and 2.7% YoY (core 0.2%), in line but core softer, signaling easing pressures versus prior hotter prints—rationale: lower core supports Fed pause. Eurozone inflation hit ECB's 2% target in Dec 2025 (down from prior), driven by energy relief despite sticky services at 3.4%, a meaningful stabilization versus above-target trends. China's Dec trade showed exports +3.9% (est.), imports +1.4%, surplus resilient amid US tariff frontloading—stable vs. prior month but high base challenges growth. Japan's Q3 GDP contracted 2.3% ann. (worse vs. initial 1.8% est.), on weak capex/residential—no fresh data this week. UK Nov GDP +0.3% (beat 0.1% est.), services-led despite construction drop, rebounding from Oct stall. Korea's BoK held rates at 2.5%, core inflation stable ~2%, GDP forecast 1.8% with upside export risks—no change vs. last week.
