## What released
- ECB: Joint EBA–ECB report on payment fraud was published on Dec 15 CET (Dec 16 KST), an official central‐bank publication, but it is not one of the targeted macro series.[2]
- ECB calendars show the Eurosystem consolidated financial statement and APP/PEPP weekly updates due Dec 16 CET (late evening KST), and HICP statistical publication due Dec 17 CET; these are scheduled, not yet released in the last 24h.[4][6]
- United States: BLS Employment Situation (Nov) is scheduled for Dec 16, 8:30 ET (22:30 KST), not yet released in the last 24h.[3][1]
- United Kingdom: ONS “UK Labour Market: December 2025” scheduled for Dec 16, 07:00 UK (16:00 KST), showing “not yet published” as of now.[5]
- US Census schedules: Monthly Retail Sales and MTIS (inventories/sales) were rescheduled to Dec 16, but the schedule indicates future releases today; no publication in the last 24h.[7][8][9][10]
- BEA schedule adjustments show many macro releases shifted; no new BEA macro release in the last 24h.[11]

## Trigger check
- Trigger (a) “any official release in past 24h”: Yes, the ECB/EBA payment fraud report qualifies as an official central-bank release, but it is not among the requested macroeconomic series. No macro series from the specified list appears published in the past 24h.[2]
- Trigger (b) “material surprise ≥1σ vs consensus or policy‑relevant revision”: Not applicable—no targeted macro series was published in the past 24h, so there is no measurable surprise or revision to flag.[8][1][5][7]

## What to watch in next hours (KST)
- US Employment Situation (Nov): 22:30 KST today; watch nonfarm payrolls, unemployment rate, average hourly earnings; BLS confirms the schedule.[1][3]
- US Census: Advance Monthly Retail Sales (Oct, rescheduled) at 22:30 KST; MTIS (Sept/Oct rescheduled) at 24:00 KST.[7][8]
- ECB: Eurosystem consolidated statement and APP/PEPP weekly updates at 23:00 KST; HICP statistics release tomorrow evening KST per ECB statistical calendar.[6][4]
- ONS: UK labour market 16:00 KST.[5]

## Immediate actions
- No surprise alert today because no targeted macro release occurred in the last 24h and thus no ≥1σ deviation or policy‑relevant revision can be assessed yet. Maintain pre‑event posture:  
  - Keep position sizes modest ahead of tonight’s US data; consider tighter stops and slightly elevated cash to manage event risk.[3][1]
  - For rates, keep neutral‑to‑slight long duration bias only if positioned for a potential softer US data print; otherwise remain close to benchmark into 22:30 KST.[1]
  - For FX, avoid adding USD or GBP exposure until releases hit; consider options (short‑dated straddles) if implied vol is attractive versus realized.[5]
  - Liquidity: Ensure execution windows around 22:25–22:45 and 23:55–00:05 KST are staffed; widen limits to account for slippage around prints.[8][7][1]
