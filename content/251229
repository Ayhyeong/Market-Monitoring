US Q3 GDP rose 4.3% annualized on December 22, exceeding Q2's 3.8%. No other major official macro releases occurred across specified regions in the past week (Dec 22-29), reflecting holiday slowdowns. This US growth beat marks a meaningful positive change from prior quarter's moderation, driven by consumer spending and exports offsetting investment declines. [bea](https://www.bea.gov)
