## Alert
- When (KST): Thu, Dec 12, 2025, 10:30 PM KST equivalent for a 8:30 AM ET release on Dec 11, 2025.[3]
- What moved:
  - US Initial Jobless Claims: 236,000, up 44,000 w/w, vs. consensus ~220,000; 4‑week average up to 216,750. Continuing claims fell to about 1.84–1.93 million depending on measure/window cited in the release and coverage. The jump exceeded most economist estimates and was highlighted as the largest increase since the pandemic onset, with seasonal adjustment noise around Thanksgiving noted by media and analysts.[5][4][3]
- Why it matters:
  - Policy relevance: Claims are a high-frequency labor market gauge that inform near‑term assessments of slack and recession risk; persistent elevation could influence the Fed’s reaction function on the margin even after recent rate cuts. The size of the weekly jump raises attention to labor market cooling risks, though holiday seasonal effects complicate interpretation.[4][5]
  - Market relevance: A perceived softening in labor conditions tends to bull‑steepen U.S. curves, pressure the USD on growth/rate‑differential expectations, and support front‑end duration and risk‑parity hedges if growth risks build.[5][4]
- Immediate actions:
  - Rates/duration: Add modest duration on front‑end and belly (2s–5s–7s) into any dip, sized conservatively given seasonal noise; consider receiving short‑tenor OIS or ED/SR futures bias for 1–2 meetings forward.[4][5]
  - Curve: Position for bull‑steepening if follow‑through soft data persist (e.g., 2s10s steepeners via swaps or cash). Use tight risk limits until confirmation by next week’s data flow.[5][4]
  - FX: Tilt slightly short USD versus low‑beta G10 (EUR, JPY) on softer U.S. growth impulse; keep stops tight given holiday volatility and European policy headlines.[1][4]
  - Equities/credit hedges: Add tactical downside hedges (e.g., S&P puts or skew via put spreads) if already long cyclicals; in credit, prefer higher‑quality IG over HY beta until claims normalize.[4][5]
  - Liquidity and sizing: Use smaller clips and wider tiers this week due to seasonal adjustment uncertainty; reassess after the next claims print and upcoming rescheduled U.S. releases.[2][5]
