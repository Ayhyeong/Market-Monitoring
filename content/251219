## What moved
- United States CPI (November 2025): Headline CPI up 2.7% year over year; core CPI up 2.6% year over year. Monthly detail was presented as a two‑month change (Sep–Nov: +0.2% SA) due to the October shutdown; shelter +0.2% over the two‑month span, energy +1.1%, food +0.1%. The release explicitly notes missing October survey collection and methodology notes. [bls](https://www.bls.gov/bls/newsrels.htm)
- United States Initial Jobless Claims (week ended Dec 13): 224,000 SA, down 13,000 from prior week (revised to 237,000); 4‑week average 217,500; continuing claims 1.897 million for week ended Dec 6. Reuters coverage indicates consensus near 225,000. [ecb.europa](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/tvservices/podcast/html/ecb.pod251218_episode120.pt.html)

## Why it matters
- CPI: The y/y pace at 2.7% with core 2.6% keeps inflation close to the Fed’s 2% objective, but the atypical two‑month presentation complicates month‑over‑month inference; markets will treat this as broadly consistent with disinflation continuing but await a clean December print. Shelter’s modest two‑month increase and still‑elevated energy services y/y (+7.4%) offer a mixed composition signal relevant for services inflation persistence and the path of policy normalization. [bls](https://www.bls.gov/bls/newsrels.htm)
- Jobless claims: Claims remain within a stable range and near consensus, signaling labor demand is cooling but not collapsing; this supports a soft‑landing narrative and reduces near‑term recession risk pricing, with implications for front‑end rates and USD.

## Immediate actions
- Rates/duration
  - Maintain a mild duration long bias in the 2–5y sector given disinflation consistency and steady labor data; avoid aggressive longs until a clean monthly CPI sequence resumes. [ecb.europa](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/tvservices/podcast/html/ecb.pod251218_episode120.pt.html)
  - Consider curve steepeners (2s10s or 5s30s) into early‑2026 if markets price higher odds of gradual easing with anchored long‑term inflation expectations. [ecb.europa](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/tvservices/podcast/html/ecb.pod251218_episode120.pt.html)
- Inflation hedges
  - Keep light TIPS exposure focused on 5y breakevens; composition shows energy services firmness but overall y/y is contained, arguing against heavy inflation‑protection adds. [bls](https://www.bls.gov/bls/newsrels.htm)
- FX
  - Slightly reduce tactical USD longs versus EUR/JPY on balanced U.S. data; ECB held rates yesterday and messaging suggests inflation near target in the medium term, limiting EUR downside near term.

- Liquidity/position sizing
  - Keep gross risk moderate ahead of holiday‑period liquidity; widen stops and reduce position sizes by 10–20% for short‑term strategies given elevated seasonal volatility in claims. [ecb.europa](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/tvservices/podcast/html/ecb.pod251218_episode120.pt.html)
