Here’s a concise, cross-region macro wrap for the past week with changes versus the prior week, source links, and a forward calendar.

US: Mixed but stable labor signals; partial data gaps persist. Initial jobless claims eased to 216k for week ending Nov 22, near 2025 lows, while continuing claims edged up to 1.96m, indicating slightly softer re-employment amid stable layoffs. With many US releases rescheduled after the shutdown, core PCE tracking remains reliant on nowcasts and estimates rather than official October/November prints, keeping inflation assessment provisional.[rbc+5](https://www.rbc.com/en/economics/us-analysis/us-featured-analysis/the-us-government-shutdown-ends-but-we-still-need-data/)​

Eurozone: Inflation near 2%, core firming at 2.4% in October; flash November country prints suggest slight uptick in headline. The ECB rhetoric remains cautious on further cuts given stickier core components.[tradingeconomics+2](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/core-inflation-rate)​

China: Official manufacturing PMI rose to 49.2 in November but stayed in contraction for an eighth month, underscoring weak domestic demand and the case for further support. Credit pulse was soft in October (TSF dropped versus September), limiting the private-sector funding impulse into Q4.[investing+4](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/chinas-factory-activity-shrinks-for-eighth-month-in-november-pmi-shows-4382581)​

Japan: Tokyo core CPI held around 2.8% in November; coupled with firmer output, this keeps a December/January BOJ hike in play. Services inflation and wage dynamics support persistence above target, even as real wages remain pressured.[bloomberg+3](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-27/tokyo-inflation-beats-forecast-keeping-boj-on-rate-hike-path)​

UK: CPI slowed to 3.6% y/y in October; housing indicators point to softer asking prices and mixed mortgage approvals into autumn, keeping affordability restraints in place. BoE remains on hold per November MPR context, watching disinflation and growth slack.[builtplace+3](https://builtplace.com/weekly-summary-21st-november-2025/)​

Korea: Early-November exports up around 8% y/y on semis/autos strength; October headline exports slowed but remained positive, pointing to continued external momentum into late Q4. Domestic activity shows mixed signals with manufacturing PMI back below 50 in October and CPI around mid-2s recently, per official bulletins.[tradingeconomics+5](https://tradingeconomics.com/south-korea/exports)​

Meaningful changes versus last week (and why)

- China growth pulse deteriorated marginally: November NBS PMI improved to 49.2 but stayed sub-50 for an eighth month, reinforcing that any sequential stabilization is weak and uneven; this shifts risks toward additional policy easing versus last week’s tentative stabilization narrative.[tradingview+1](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_P8N3R3034:0-china-s-factory-activity-shrinks-for-eighth-month-in-november-pmi-shows/)​
    
- Japan inflation and policy path: Tokyo core CPI staying near 2.8% plus firmer output increased odds for a near-term BOJ hike compared with a week ago when the policy path was more evenly balanced across December/January.[reuters+1](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/core-consumer-prices-japans-capital-rise-28-yryr-november-2025-11-27/)​
    
- US labor steadied at low claims: Another dip in initial claims to 216k reduced near-term recession signaling versus last week’s prints, even as continuing claims trend higher; the split argues for slower hiring but limited layoffs compared with prior week’s labor tone.[tradingeconomics+1](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/jobless-claims)​
    
- Eurozone inflation tone little changed: October headline near 2% with core at 2.4% keeps last week’s “near target headline, sticky core” stance intact.[tradingeconomics+1](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi)​
    
- Korea external momentum intact: First-20-day export growth near 8% y/y, with semiconductors strong, supports the view of tech-led recovery persisting into month-end versus last week’s early read-throughs.[bloomberg+2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-21/south-korea-s-early-trade-data-show-export-momentum-continues)​

Actionable playbook

- Hedges:
    
    - Growth downside: Own duration via intermediate USTs into data catch-up uncertainty, add equity downside via S&P puts around major prints.[clevelandfed+1](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting)​
        
    - China demand risk: Hedge EM Asia beta with CNH downside or MSCI China put spreads around PMI/credit windows.[investing+1](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/chinas-factory-activity-shrinks-for-eighth-month-in-november-pmi-shows-4382581)​
        
- Rates/duration/curve:
    
    - US: Modestly long duration; favor 5s–10s over front end until core inflation prints firm up; keep modest 2s10s steepener optionality into December meeting.[clevelandfed+1](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting)​
        
    - Eurozone: Neutral duration; sticky core vs near-target headline argues for carry in semi-core; avoid aggressive bull steepeners until HICP finalized.[tradingeconomics+2](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi)​
        
    - Japan: Reduce JGB duration beta; position for mild bear steepening if BOJ signals December/January hike.[reuters+1](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/core-consumer-prices-japans-capital-rise-28-yryr-november-2025-11-27/)​

    - Korea: Neutral; external tailwinds but domestic PMI soft—keep flexibility for BOK guidance shifts.[tradingeconomics+2](https://tradingeconomics.com/south-korea/manufacturing-pmi)​
        
- FX tilts:
    
    - USD: Mildly supported by US growth resilience and policy uncertainty; tactically long DXY into data week, but fade on soft core prints.[tradingeconomics+2](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/jobless-claims)​
        
    - EUR: Range-bound; stickiness in core limits dovish repricing—neutral to slightly constructive vs GBP.[tradingeconomics+1](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/core-inflation-rate)​
        
    - JPY: Keep some long JPY optionality on BOJ hike risk in Dec/Jan.[bloomberg+1](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-27/tokyo-inflation-beats-forecast-keeping-boj-on-rate-hike-path)​

    - GBP: Sideways bias; wait for next CPI and housing follow-through.[tradingeconomics+1](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/mortgage-approvals)​
        
- Equities: sector tilts
    
    - Overweight: Semiconductors and autos in Korea/global where export momentum persists; quality growth/large-cap tech in US amid stable labor and benign nowcasted inflation.[clevelandfed+2](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting)​
        
    - Underweight: China domestic cyclicals until PMI returns above 50 and TSF re-accelerates.[investing+1](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/chinas-factory-activity-shrinks-for-eighth-month-in-november-pmi-shows-4382581)​

- Credit stance:
    
    - Favor IG over HY given China demand softness and US data uncertainty; keep HY exposure in higher-quality BBs with low refi risk.[bea+2](https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule)​
        
    - In EM Asia, prefer Korea IG exporters over China property/cyclicals given export momentum vs credit softness.[tradingeconomics+1](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/total-social-financing)​
        
- Liquidity checklist (next week):
    
    - Confirm collateral and cash ladders ahead of FOMC/US catch-up data dates.[bea](https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule)​

    - Stagger orders around China PMI/credit windows; wider spreads likely into prints.[investing+1](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/chinas-factory-activity-shrinks-for-eighth-month-in-november-pmi-shows-4382581)​
