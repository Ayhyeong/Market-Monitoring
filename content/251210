## Alert — Korea labor report (Nov 2025)
- When (KST): 2025-12-10 (morning Seoul time).[2][1]
- What moved:
  - Unemployment rate (sa): 2.7% in November, up from 2.6% in October.[2]
  - Headline employment: Statistics Korea reported the “economically active population” release for November on Dec 10. (Official release marker and timing reference).[1]
- Why it matters:
  - Labor tightness and employment momentum feed into Bank of Korea policy assessment of domestic demand and services inflation; even a small uptick in joblessness from very low levels keeps focus on whether labor conditions are gradually normalizing rather than re‑tightening.[2]
  - Korea’s macro now sits alongside elevated liquidity concerns raised recently (BoK communications and market commentary), making labor/demand data relevant to the BoK’s hold‑bias and monitoring of inflation persistence.[3]
- Immediate actions:
  - Duration/curve: Maintain a modest long duration bias in KRW rates until clearer acceleration in wage or services inflation emerges; the slight uptick in joblessness does not argue for near‑term BoK hikes. Position size small given data is not a clear surprise.[2]
  - FX tilt: Neutral to slightly constructive KRW if subsequent activity data stabilize; avoid aggressive KRW longs ahead of upcoming global prints. Use tight stops given liquidity narratives around M2 can add KRW volatility.[3]
  - Equities: No change in beta; lean toward domestically defensive exposure if labor softness broadens, but the current move is marginal. Hedge with index puts 1–2% OTM on a 1–2 week horizon, small premium outlay.[2]
  - Liquidity/ops: No special collateral or margin actions required; keep dry powder for potential moves around next major global releases (e.g., U.S. CPI, retail sales).[4]
