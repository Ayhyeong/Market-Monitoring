## What changed vs last week (by region)

- United States: Limited fresh top-tier official prints in the last week; focus shifts to the late‑November cluster (GDP 2nd, durable goods, goods trade, PCE, new home sales) on published calendars, so the near-term “change” is positioning into these known releases rather than new data surprises this past week. Housing micro-estimates continue to show a tepid single‑family recovery pace, keeping housing a drag versus mid‑year; official release cadence points to confirmation risk rather than reversal for now. Rationale: official calendars show the key releases are due in the coming days, not last week, while industry nowcasts keep the housing impulse soft.[newyorkfed+4](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/calendars/nationalecon_cal)​
    
- Eurozone: October HICP final confirmed 2.1% YoY, broadly consistent with the flash; November PMIs show services holding above 50 while manufacturing remains sub‑50, leaving the composite near 52.4; the growth pulse is still uneven but marginally firmer than early Q3; this is not a step‑change vs last week but consolidates the soft‑landing bias. Rationale: Eurostat’s October inflation confirmation removes an upside shock risk, while PMIs keep manufacturing weak and services ok, limiting directional change week‑over‑week.[tradingeconomics+1](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/indicators)​
    
- United Kingdom: Official CPI for October printed 3.6% YoY, down from 3.8% in September; services cooled marginally, reinforcing a gradual disinflation trend; this is an incremental softening versus last week’s priors and supports near‑term BoE patience. Rationale: the ONS release shows headline and core easing, a clean improvement versus the prior month.[ons+2](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/october2025)​
    
- Japan: October national CPI accelerated to 3.0% YoY headline and 3.0% ex-fresh food; ex fresh food and energy at 3.1%; this is a modest uptick and a meaningful change versus last week’s expectation of stability, keeping pressure on the BOJ ahead of the December meeting. Rationale: official-statistics-based reports show a notch higher across the key core gauges, sustaining above‑target prints.[fxstreet+2](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/japans-national-cpi-rises-30-yoy-in-october-core-cpi-climbs-as-expected-202511202331)​
    
- China: No major new official releases in the past week; the last official batch had October IP up 4.9% YoY and weak retail momentum; the week‑over‑week change is limited, with the macro narrative anchored in subdued domestic demand and price pressure from excess supply in select sectors. Rationale: NBS last postings are mid‑November for October activity; structural commentary signals no fresh inflection in the past week.[deloitte+1](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update.html)​
    
- Korea: October CPI accelerated to 2.4% YoY; the week’s official outlook updates emphasized export resilience (semiconductors) and slightly higher inflation projections into year‑end; relative to last week, the balance of risks tilts mildly less disinflationary and more growth‑supported by external demand. Rationale: MOEF’s November situation report and Statistics Korea schedules frame inflation near 2–2.5% with exports firmer; that’s a small but notable shift versus earlier softer prints.[english.moef+2](https://english.moef.go.kr/pc/selectTbPressCenterDtl.do?boardCd=N0001&seq=6293)​
    

## Risk‑backdrop summary (pillars)

- Growth: Eurozone composite PMI near 52 supports soft‑landing odds, but manufacturing contraction persists; US growth read‑through awaits this week’s GDP/durables cluster; Korea external demand (semis) constructive; China growth mix subdued with weak consumption offset by selected output strength.[stats+3](https://www.stats.gov.cn/english/PressRelease/)​
    
- Inflation: Eurozone October HICP finalized at 2.1% stabilizes disinflation; UK CPI eased to 3.6%; Japan core ticked to 3.0–3.1%, sustaining above target and lifting BOJ risk; Korea at 2.4% keeps it near target zone; US to be defined by upcoming PCE with no new official print last week.[europa+4](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-euro-indicators/w/2-19112025-ap)​

- Housing: US official data pending late‑November; industry estimates point to cautious single‑family improvement but still below prior peaks; UK/Eurozone housing not a primary driver in this week’s official flows.[tradingeconomics+2](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/calendar)​
    
- External/trade: Korea’s official outlook flags firm exports in October; US goods trade and China customs data are due in coming windows; week‑over‑week sees Korea modestly better, others steady awaiting prints.[tradingeconomics+2](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/calendar)​

## Updated multi‑asset playbook

- Duration/curve:
    
    - US: Maintain modest long duration bias heading into PCE/GDP, with a tactical pay‑5s30s flattener hedge given upside CPI risk from services later, sized smaller given data uncertainty windows on the NY Fed calendar.[newyorkfed+1](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/calendars/nationalecon_cal)​
        
    - Eurozone: Neutral to slightly long duration; HICP final at 2.1% reduces near‑term bear risk; keep curve neutral given mixed PMI profile.[tradingeconomics+1](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/indicators)​
        
    - UK: Neutral duration; inflation is easing but still elevated; await next ONS print; tactical receive front‑end on dips.[ons+1](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/october2025)​
        
    - Japan: Stay underweight JGB duration into December BOJ with core at 3.0–3.1% sustaining risk of policy adjustment.[fxstreet+1](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/japans-national-cpi-rises-30-yoy-in-october-core-cpi-climbs-as-expected-202511202331)​
        
    - Korea: Neutral to modest short duration; MOEF flags higher KTB yields and slightly firmer inflation profile.[english.moef+1](https://english.moef.go.kr/pc/selectTbPressCenterDtl.do?boardCd=N0001&seq=6293)​
        
- FX tilts:
    
    - USD: Range‑bound bias into data week; optionality around PCE/GDP dates from NY Fed calendar advisable.[fred.stlouisfed+1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar)​
        
    - EUR: Mildly constructive vs USD given disinflation plus resilient services PMI, but capped by weak manufacturing; prefer EUR in crosses vs low‑beta Asia ex‑Japan.[tradingeconomics+1](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/indicators)​
        
    - GBP: Sideways to slightly firmer with CPI easing reducing policy risk premium; avoid chasing strength into thin data week.[tradingeconomics+1](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/inflation-cpi)​
        
    - JPY: Prefer long JPY into BOJ event risk; sustained above‑target core supports tail of policy tweak.[reuters+1](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-core-inflation-accelerates-october-stays-above-boj-target-2025-11-20/)​
        
    - KRW: Neutral to slight positive on exports tone but mindful of yields and inflation path; event‑risk hedges ahead of BOK and Dec releases.[tradingeconomics+2](https://tradingeconomics.com/south-korea/inflation-cpi)​
        
- Equities sector tilts:
    
    - US: Overweight quality growth and software/services into data week; underweight homebuilders given soft starts backdrop in industry estimates and pending official confirmation.[construction+1](https://www.construction.com/blog/a-new-look-at-estimating-census-construction-starts-and-spending/)​
        
    - Eurozone: Overweight services/consumer staples; underweight cyclicals leveraged to manufacturing contraction.[europa+1](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-euro-indicators/w/2-19112025-ap)​
        
    - UK: Overweight domestic defensives benefiting from disinflation drift; underweight rate‑sensitives until the gilt curve stabilizes.[ons+1](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/october2025)​
        
    - Japan: Overweight financials and select value beneficiaries of steepening risk if BOJ pivots; hedge exporters’ FX beta.[fxstreet+1](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/japans-national-cpi-rises-30-yoy-in-october-core-cpi-climbs-as-expected-202511202331)​
        
    - Korea: Overweight semiconductors on exports impulse; neutral broader cyclical complex pending December data.[english.moef](https://english.moef.go.kr/pc/selectTbPressCenterDtl.do?boardCd=N0001&seq=6293)​
        
- Credit quality stance:
    
    - US/EU IG over HY; spreads supported by disinflation and soft‑landing odds, but carry in HY vulnerable to growth/margin wobble if PMIs stall; keep HY exposure up‑quality.[tradingeconomics+1](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/indicators)​
        
    - UK IG over HY as CPI eases but growth remains mixed; favor defensives.[tradingeconomics+1](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/inflation-cpi)​
        
    - Japan/Korea: Prefer high‑grade corporates; BOJ/BOK event risk argues for conservative beta.[tradingeconomics+2](https://tradingeconomics.com/south-korea/inflation-cpi)​
        
- Hedges:
    
    - Own gamma around US data windows (GDP/PCE) per NY Fed/FRED timing; skew to downside in cyclicals vs index.[newyorkfed+1](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/calendars/nationalecon_cal)​
        
    - Long JPY calls vs USD into BOJ; EUR downside put spreads vs USD around late‑month HICP flashes.[europa+1](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/news/euro-indicators/release-calendar)​
        
    - US rates payer swaptions 5s30s as curve‑flattening hedge if services inflation re‑accelerates later.[newyorkfed](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/calendars/nationalecon_cal)​
        
- Liquidity checklist:
    
    - Confirm release times on NY Fed and FRED calendars and stage orders outside the 5‑minute windows around drops.[fred.stlouisfed+1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar)​
        
    - Keep dry powder for BOJ week; scale hedges rather than binary positions given CPI variance.[stat+1](https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/cpi/1582.html)​
        
    - For Korea, note Statistics Korea CPI on Dec 2; reduce KRW basis risk ahead of the print.[kostat](https://kostat.go.kr/menu.es?mid=a20301000000)​
