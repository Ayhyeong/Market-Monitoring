## **1. UNITED STATES – Federal Reserve Policy & Data Blackout**

### **Release Details**
- **Date/Time:** October 29, 2025, 2:00 PM EDT
- **Source:** Federal Reserve FOMC
- **Official Release:** [Federal Reserve Statement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm)

### **What Moved**
**FOMC Decision:**
- **Fed Funds Target:** 3.75-4.00% (25bp cut, as expected)
- **Dissents:** 2 members – one favored 50bp cut, one opposed cut
- **Quantitative Tightening:** **Ends December 1, 2025**
  - MBS runoff proceeds reinvested in Treasury bills
  - Balance sheet to stabilize at **$6.59 trillion**

**Economic Data Context:**
- **September CPI:** 3.0% YoY vs. 3.1% expected (0.3% MoM)
- **Core CPI:** 3.0% YoY vs. 3.1% expected
- **August Nonfarm Payrolls:** 22K vs. 75K expected (massive miss)
- **Initial Jobless Claims (Sept 20):** 218K vs. 235K expected
- **Government Shutdown:** BLS/Census data releases suspended since Oct 1; September/October employment data **delayed indefinitely**

### **Why It Matters**
**Policy Relevance:**
- **Split Committee:** 10-2 vote with divergent dissents signals uncertainty on path forward
- **Data Blackout:** Fed navigating "blind" without payrolls, retail sales, housing starts for October
- **Labor Market Revision:** 911K jobs downward revision for 12 months through March 2025 (largest since 2000)
- **QT Termination:** Signals policy floor reached; reserves at ~10% GDP (lower bound of "ample" range)

**Market Pricing:**
- December cut: 60% probability (down from 85% pre-meeting)
- Terminal rate expectations: 3.25-3.50% (up from 3.00%)
- 10Y UST yield: 4.28%, +15bp since FOMC

### **Immediate Actions**

**Duration/Curve:**
- **Fade front-end easing:** Receive 2Y UST at 3.90-4.00%; Fed pause likely if jobs data improves when released
- **5s30s steepeners:** Balance sheet stabilization reduces long-end supply pressure
- **TIPS:** Real yields attractive at 2.0% on 10Y; inflation floor at 3% with tariff risks

**FX:**
- **Long USD basket:** DXY targeting 108-110 on Fed hawkish pause vs. global easing (ECB, BoE, RBA)
- **USD/JPY:** Buy dips to 152 targeting 155-157; BoJ dovish, Fed cautious
- **Hedges:** USD/CNH appreciation risk from Trump tariff rhetoric; buy 1-month 7.35 calls

**Position Sizing:**
- Reduce US equity beta by 20%; labor data uncertainty + Fed caution = volatility spike risk
- Overweight defensives (healthcare, utilities) until employment picture clears

**Liquidity:**
- **Critical:** Monitor SOFR vs. Fed RRP facility usage (QT end signal); potential year-end squeeze
- Fed balance sheet floor at $6.59T; if reserves drop below 9% GDP, emergency repo operations likely
