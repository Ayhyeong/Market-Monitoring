## 3. Updated Playbook & Tactical Tilts

Given the cautious tilt in vol and latent macro risks:

### Hedging / Protection

- **Equity puts / index hedges:** modest allocation to S&P 500 or regional index puts (e.g. US, Korea)
    
- **Vol strategies:** consider long-VIX futures or options in small size as a tail hedge
    
- **Credit hedges:** credit default swaps (CDS) on high beta issuers or HY/IG indices (light)
    

### Duration / Curve Stance

- Underweight in front-end (2s) exposure; consider moderate lengthening or butterfly positions
    
- Avoid aggressive bear steepening bets yet â€” curve signals not extreme
    

### FX Tilts

- Mild USD underweight â€” if global risk softens, USD may revert
    
- Monitor JPY and EUR crossâ€‘basis (not yet triggered)
    

### Equity Sector Tilts

- Favor defensive / quality sectors (healthcare, staples, utilities)
    
- Underweight cyclicals, financials, commodityâ€‘sensitive sectors
    

### Credit Quality

- Preference toward IG over HY
    
- Light exposure to lower credit tiers; maintain liquidity buffer
    

### Liquidity & Position Sizing Checklist

- Maintain â‰¥â€¯5â€“10â€¯% cash or liquid equivalents
    
- Set stop-loss / auto hedges on directional bets
    
- Avoid concentrated directional exposures; favor scaled beta
    
- Keep management of margin / collateral ready
    

**Watch these levels closely:**

- VIX approaching midâ€‘30s zone
    
- MOVE breaking above 120â€“140 range
    
- HY OAS widening over 400â€“500 bps
    
- Sharp moves in crossâ€‘currency basis or funding spreadse
