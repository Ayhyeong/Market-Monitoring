## 1) Past week: official macro releases (by economy & pillar)

### United States

* **Inflation:** BLS confirmed **September CPI is rescheduled to Fri, Oct 24**, so no new CPI last week. ([Census.gov][1])
* **Growth / Industry:** The Fed’s **G.17 Industrial Production** report scheduled for Oct 17 **was not published**, so no new September IP signal. ([Census.gov][2])
* **Credit conditions:** **H.8 weekly banking data (to Oct 8) out on Oct 17** show total bank credit roughly **flat to slightly higher w/w** (Table shows $18.76T vs $18.76T prior week; small uptick from late‑Sep). Interpretation: credit supply not tightening further on the margin. ([Federal Reserve][3])
* **Housing:** **New Residential Construction** September release normally due Oct 17 **has not been posted yet** on the Census “Historical Releases” page (latest visible is August). ([Census.gov][4])
* **Labor:** Regular **weekly jobless claims** posting cadence has been irregular amid federal website updates; no fresh, citable DOL claims PDF for Oct 16 visible on the newsroom. ([DOL][5])

**Change vs last week:** The absence of CPI/IP kept the U.S. macro impulse **unchanged**. H.8 shows **no renewed credit squeeze**, a mild positive vs the prior week.

---

### Euro Area

* **External/trade:** **August trade**: euro area **€1.0bn surplus** (NSA); SA balance improved to **€9.7bn** from **€6.0bn** in July—imports fell faster than exports. ([European Commission][6])
* **Inflation:** **September HICP (final)** release cycle was scheduled late last week; confirmation of the flash estimate is standard—no policy‑relevant surprise flagged by Eurostat publications page in this window. *(Trade link above is the main new hard print last week.)* ([European Commission][7])

**Change vs last week:** **External** pillar **improved on SA basis** (larger surplus vs July), easing growth‑drag from net trade. Inflation narrative **unchanged** pending next prints.

---

### China

* **Credit conditions:** **PBoC Financial Statistics (Q1–Q3)** published Oct 15 indicate **September TSF and RMB loan flows** consistent with typical quarter‑end strengthening (details in the quarterly note). Rationale: seasonal front‑loading and policy support. ([pbc.gov.cn][8])
* **External/trade:** **GACC September trade tables** dated **Oct 13** (national totals by category) were posted on Customs’ statistics portal. Interpretation: official monthly bulletin is in place; September is the current reference month for external. ([gdfs.customs.gov.cn][9])

**Change vs last week:** **Credit** pillar **firmer** (quarter‑end TSF), providing a modest cushion to growth. **External** data now finalized for September, replacing August as the latest baseline.

---

### Japan

* **Services activity (growth):** **METI Tertiary Industry Activity Index (Aug)** published **Oct 16**. (Monthly movement is the freshest read on services output.) ([Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry][10])
* **Industry (growth):** **Industrial Production (Aug, revised)** published **Oct 15**. ([Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry][11])
* **Machinery orders (capex proxy):** Cabinet Office “What’s New” records **Machinery Orders (Aug)** publication **Oct 16**. ([cao.go.jp][12])

**Change vs last week:** Japan’s **growth** pillar gained **fresh late‑Aug confirmation** (services & IP revised, machinery orders posted). No meaningful **inflation** or **labor** updates in the week.

---

### United Kingdom

* **Labor:** **Labour market overview (Oct release, covering Jun–Aug)** on **Oct 14**—employment softening with higher unemployment and easing vacancies per ONS bulletin. ([Office for National Statistics][13])

**Change vs last week:** **Labor** pillar **weaker** than the prior week’s status quo (new ONS update shows additional softening), raising near‑term growth risk.

---

### Korea

* **Labor:** **September Employment Trends** press release **Oct 17** (official). ([국가데이터처][14])
* **Prices / external indices:** **Export/Import Price Index (Sep, preliminary)** published **Oct 17** by the Bank of Korea—useful for pipeline inflation and terms‑of‑trade. ([Bank of Korea][15])

**Change vs last week:** New official **labor** and **external price** prints arrived; headline macro picture **broadly unchanged**, but export prices edged up m/m (BOK), a mild **inflation‑pipeline** watchpoint.

---

## 2) Upcoming key event calendar (Mon 20 Oct – Sun 26 Oct, local dates)

* **US:** **CPI (Sep)** – **Fri, Oct 24** (rescheduled), **Census New Home Sales (Sep)** also **Fri, Oct 24** (per standard calendar; watch site posting). ([Census.gov][1])
* **UK:** **CPI (Sep)** – **Wed, Oct 22**; **Retail Sales (Sep)** – **Fri, Oct 24** (per ONS calendar cadence & dataset “next release”). ([Office for National Statistics][16])
* **Japan:** **National CPI (Sep)** – typically **Fri, Oct 24**; **BoJ MPM** is **the following week (Oct 29–30)**. ([Bank of Japan][17])
* **Euro Area:** Next **ECB monetary policy meeting** is **Oct 29–30** (the week after this one). ([European Central Bank][18])
* **US (Fed) context:** Next **FOMC** meeting window is in early November per official calendar/blackout schedule. ([Federal Reserve][19])

---

## 3) Risk‑backdrop summary (concise)

* **Growth:** Euro area **trade SA balance improved** in Aug, marginally supportive. Japan’s **services/IP** revisions add **incremental stabilization** signs for late‑Q3. U.S. growth read‑throughs are **data‑light** (IP delayed; retail/housing prints pending), keeping uncertainty **elevated** into Oct 24. ([European Commission][6])
* **Inflation:** U.S. CPI **blackout until Oct 24**; UK CPI **Oct 22**; Korea **export prices up m/m**—mild pipeline pressure. Net‑net, **no decisive change** vs last week, but **event risk high** (UK Wed, US Fri). ([Census.gov][1])
* **Labor:** **UK** labour market **softened** (Oct ONS release). **Korea** posted September employment—headline picture **stable**. U.S. **claims** signal not freshly published. ([Office for National Statistics][13])
* **Housing:** **US** September **starts/sales** still pending/uncertain posting; **no new EA/UK/JP official housing** prints last week; pillar **unchanged**. ([Census.gov][4])
* **External/trade:** **EA August** improved SA surplus; **China** September trade tables posted; **Korea** trade price indices firmed—collectively, **external** slightly **less of a drag** vs last week. ([European Commission][6])
* **Credit conditions:** **US H.8** shows **flat-to-slightly rising** bank credit; **China TSF** seasonally **stronger** in September; **net** credit backdrop **a touch easier** than last week. ([Federal Reserve][3])

## 4) Playbook — updated actions

**Hedges**

* **Event‑risk hedges** into **Wed (UK CPI)** and **Fri (US CPI)**: short‑dated **rate vol** (straddles in GBP and USD front‑end), and **equity index downside** via put spreads sized to implied move. Rationale: concentrated macro catalysts after a thin U.S. data week. ([Office for National Statistics][16])

**Rates: duration & curve**

* **USD duration:** **Neutral to modest long** into CPI given absent tightening in H.8 and elevated event risk; **take profits** on rallies post‑print. **Curve:** favor **2s10s micro‑steepeners** tactically (room for front‑end to lead on benign CPI surprise). ([Federal Reserve][3])
* **GBP duration:** **Tactically neutral** until CPI; reassess on services‑inflation breadth. ([Office for National Statistics][16])
* **EUR duration:** **Hold neutral‑long**—EA external improvement reduces tail‑risk but core growth still soft. ([European Commission][6])
* **JPY rates:** **Stay neutral** ahead of next‑week BoJ; local activity data were incremental only. ([Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry][10])

**FX tilts**

* **Modest long USD vs GBP** into Wed if UK CPI risks skew higher; **optional long USD vs cyclical Asia FX** given China’s TSF lift is seasonal and may fade. **Keep optionality** (strangles) in **USD/JPY** into BoJ week. ([Office for National Statistics][16])

**Equities: sector tilts**

* **Overweight**: **Quality/defensives** (Healthcare, Staples) into CPI cluster; **Energy** neutral‑to‑slight overweight given export price firmness in Korea and lingering commodity resilience.
* **Underweight**: **Domestic cyclicals** (Homebuilders in US) until housing prints clear; **EU exporters** marginally upgraded from underweight to **neutral** on improving EA trade SA balance. ([European Commission][6])

**Credit stance**

* **Up‑in‑quality** (IG over HY); no sign of acute bank‑credit contraction in U.S. H.8, but carry is late‑cycle and event‑risk high this week. Prefer **short IG** and **defensive securitized** exposure. ([Federal Reserve][3])

**Liquidity checklist (this week)**

* Confirm counterparty **margin thresholds** and **IM** ahead of **Oct 22/24** prints.
* **Pre‑fund collateral** buffers for 2–3 σ moves in rates & FX.
* Avoid **crowded end‑of‑day rolls** on Wed/Fri; stage orders.
* Keep **cash buffers** for opportunities post‑prints; avoid leverage increases until U.S. CPI lands.

**Bottom line:** Compared with last week, **no decisive macro inflection**—**U.S. data vacuum** persists until Fri; **EA external** marginally better; **China credit** seasonally firmer; **UK labor** softer. Maintain a **defensive, event‑hedged** posture into **Oct 22/24**.
